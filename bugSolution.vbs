Early Binding and Explicit Type Handling:
To avoid late-binding issues, use early binding by declaring object variables with specific types.  This allows for compile-time checking.  Also, be explicit about data types to avoid unexpected type coercion.
```vbscript
Dim objExcel As Object
On Error Resume Next  'Handle potential errors gracefully
Set objExcel = GetObject(, "Excel.Application")
If Err.Number <> 0 Then
  MsgBox "Excel is not running. Exiting.", vbCritical
  WScript.Quit
End If
On Error GoTo 0
' ... safe code to use objExcel
```
Explicit type conversion prevents implicit coercion:
```vbscript
Dim num1 As Integer, num2 As String
num1 = 10
num2 = "20"
Dim sum As Integer
sum = num1 + CInt(num2) 'Explicit conversion of string to integer
```
